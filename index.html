        Welcome to Your Debt Support Hub
        Over the past five years, personal debt in the UK has risen sharply — not because people were reckless, but because many were caught in circumstances beyond their control.

    <h2>What Happened?</h2>

        <ul>
<li>Lockdown and Furlough (2020): When the UK went into lockdown, millions were placed on furlough, receiving only 80% of their salary. Spending dropped to historic lows, but bills didn’t stop</li>                  
<li>Energy Crisis (2021–2022): The collapse of energy suppliers and soaring tariffs left households trapped. Switching to cheaper providers was blocked, and those on benefits or with arrears had no way out</li>       
<li>Cost-of-Living Pressures: Inflation surged, wages stagnated, and essentials became more expensive. Many relied on credit just to keep afloat</li>      
<li>Financial Institutions’ Role: Consumer credit was aggressively marketed during recovery, pushing borrowing as a solution. When repayments faltered, debts were sold to collection agencies — often prioritising corporate tax strategies over fairness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Reality in Numbers</h2>

    <ul>        
<li>Household Debt-to-Income Ratio: Fell during lockdown but climbed again with living costs. By mid-2025, households owed 117% of their disposable income</li>
<li>Consumer Credit: After net repayments in early 2020, borrowing rebounded. By 2024, consumer credit growth returned, driven by personal loans and credit cards</li>
<li>Energy Arrears: Citizens Advice reported a surge in energy debt during 2022, with millions unable to clear balances before switching suppliers</li>
<li>Insolvencies: Individual insolvencies rose to 30,494 in Q2 2025, up 3.2% year-on-year. a sign of systemic strain, not personal failure</li>

<h2>Our Promise</h2>
        
        This site offers free, unbiased, and non-judgmental advice. We understand debt isn’t about luxury — it’s about survival in a system that failed many. Our goal is to help you regain control, without blame.
        Our aim is simple: to help you understand your rights, challenge unfair practices, and regain control with clarity and confidence. No jargon. No judgment. Just guidance grounded in fairness.

    </p>


    <h2>Why this matters</h2>

    <p>
       A victim is a victim — financial, legal, medical or emotional.  
       We believe justice must never depend on a person's financial status. Especially when that financial status is a direct result of events beyond your control.
       We are not solicitors, nor do we claim to be.  
       We aim to create awareness and self-empowerment so you can take back control.
