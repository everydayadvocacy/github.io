    <p>Empowering fairness, dignity and clarity.</p>

    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
        This platform exists to restore fairness in a system where fear, confusion and imbalance too often rule.
        Everyday Advocacy is built for real people facing real pressures — from debt collection to council tax issues,
        housing problems, and everyday legal challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our aim is simple: to help you understand your rights, challenge unfair practices, and regain control with clarity
        and confidence. No jargon. No judgement. Just guidance grounded in fairness.
    </p>

    <h3>Why this matters</h3>
    <p>
        A victim is a victim — financial, legal, medical or emotional. Justice must never depend on money, status or
        representation. Everyday Advocacy is here to support those who deserve clarity, fairness and dignity.
